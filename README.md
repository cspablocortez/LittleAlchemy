# LittleAlchemy

The set of C# scripts for Brandon's Little Alchemy Unity project.

This repository includes old files from previous classes and the new 
implementation from the end of class on Thursday 2 May.

The new files are as follows:

1. `UIManager.cs` - a file to be attached to the `Canvas` element to disable all 
buttons at the start of the game.

2. `CollisionScript.cs` - in this demo of the collision, you will see the call 
to the `EnableButtonByTag()` method, which activates a UI element based on the 
given tag.

*Note:* The use of `UIManager.cs` requires that the buttons array 
field be initialized from the inspector before starting the game.

For next lesson, we will go over these changes and implement them to the 
project. Feel free to attempt the implementation before our next class.
