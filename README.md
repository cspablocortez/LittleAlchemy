# LittleAlchemy

The set of C# scripts for Brandon's Little Alchemy Unity project.

This repository includes old files from previous classes and the new 
implementation from the end of class on Thursday 2 May.

The new files are as follows:

1. `UIManager.cs` - a file to be attached to the `Canvas` element to disable all 
buttons at the start of the game.

2. `CollisionScript.cs` - in this demo of the collision, you will see the call 
to the `EnableButtonByTag()` method, which activates a UI element based on the 
given tag.

*Note:* The use of `UIManager.cs` requires that the buttons array 
field be initialized from the inspector before starting the game.


### Thursday 16 May

1. We will create a UI Manager script 

2. Follow steps listed in `UIManager.cs`

3.
